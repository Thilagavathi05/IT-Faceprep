Azure
	Capital expenditure versus operational expenditure
Capital expenditure - has sone key characteristics that,
	1. own expenditure
	2. Big initial investment
	3. Lot of maintenance required
		Support staff
		Power and networking
		Hardware failures etc...
Operational expenditure - renting some infrastructure of buying services
	1.Rent infrastructure
	2.No initial investment - pay for what you use
	3.Minimal maintenance - operations team
CONSUMPTION BASED MODEL:
	You can pay only for the resources as much as the resources that you consumed.

KUBERNETES(AKS - Azure Kubernetes Service)

	It is a kind of an open source platform for automating the deploymnet
scaling and management of the containerized application
	Cluster, Container
CONTAINER:

	A container typically refers to a lightweight, portable and consistent environment
that packages an application and all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across
different environment.
	A container is a standardized unit of software that includes everything needed to run 
an application: the code, runtime, libraries, and configurations.
	Containers are isolated from each other and the host environment but share the 
same operating system kernel, making them lightweight and efficient.
	DOCKER is a popular platform for creating and managing containers.
	KUBERNETES is an orchestration platform used to manage and scale containerized
applications.
AZURE SERVICES FOR CONTAINERS:
	1.AKS-Azure Kubernetes Service - It offers  simplified kubernetes cluster management
with features like scaling, updates and monitoring.

	2.ACI - Azure Container Instances - A lightweight, serverless way to run containers without managing
underlying infrastructure. Suitable for single container or small workloads.

	3.Azure App Service for Containers - A fully managed platform for deploying web apps or API using containers
Supports custom docker containers and integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

	4.Azure Red Hat OpenShift - A managed Kubernetes service built on Red Hat OpenShift for running containers.
Provides additional enterprise features and openshift compatibility.

	5. ACR-Azure Container Registry - A private registry for storing and managing container images. 
Supports integration with other azure services like ACI, AKS and app services.

CONTAINER WORKS IN AZURE:

	1.BUILD THE CONTAINER:
		Developers create a container image using docker or other container tools.The image contains
the application and its dependencies.
	2. STORE THE CONTAINER:
		The image is stored in a registry, such as docker hub or azure container registry.
	3.DEPLOY THE CONTAINER:
		The container image is pulled from the registry and deployed to an azure service
like ACI,AKS or app service.
	4.RUN THE CONTAINER:
		Once deployed, the container runs in the specified azure environment and serves the application
to the users.
