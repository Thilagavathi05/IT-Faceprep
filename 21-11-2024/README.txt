Hi team,
Today I have workedd with the project in solution architect that includes the services
Cloudwatch, Lambda and SNS.
 I have searched about the real time error monitoring and notification system.

Here we have to build an automated system to monitor specific logs for error 
events in an applictaion.
We can use AWS Lambda to process log data, SNS for sending notification and 
cloudwatch for monitoring and triggering alerts.
